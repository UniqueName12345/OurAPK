# Our APK

Our APK is a community driven APK where you can PR anything and I will add it.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

(Note: a-lot-of-free-time and patience is optional when using Android Studio)

```
android-studio (or another apk builder program), a-lot-of-free-time, patience
```

### Installing

This is how you are going to build the APK.

1. Open Android Studio. You can do this using the command listed below:

```
android-studio
```

Open this repo, then press build. Too lazy? Simply fork this and build it for other people to use. Make sure you stay up to date with the PR's though!


## Running the tests

No need to worry about them RN. 🙂

## Deployment

Build it, then add to a usb. Plug usb in, then go to file browser and go to "Flash Drive". Then install APK. Simple as that.
