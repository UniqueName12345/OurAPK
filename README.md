# Our APK
 The community driven apk! Issue a feature request, concerning or not, and I will add it eventually. Or just fork it and add your own features. Or even better, MAKE A NEW PR for the feature you want to add.
 ## Rules
 There is no such thing as a free lunch, so there will have to be some gorund rules, or else this will go to the ground!
 1: No illicit stuff.
 2: No racist stuff.
 3: Have fun!
 4: If you want to add malware to this, make sure you specify that it is malware, and I will add it in a red button that is labelled "Malware."
 5. Feel free to PR the readme file as much as you want, just do not delete anything above the line.
 ### Guidelines
    1: Please dont add seizure inducing stuff. If you really HAVE to, at least put a seizure warning before the seizure inducing bit.
    2: More later. :sweatsmile:
And that is pretty much it for now!
