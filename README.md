# Our APK

Our APK is a community driven APK where you can PR anything and I will add it.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```

### Installing

This is how you are going to build the APK

1. Open Android Studio. You can do this using the command listed below:
